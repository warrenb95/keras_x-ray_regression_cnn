# keras_x-ray_regression_cnn

## Description
This is my final year project for my BSc Computer Science course. The project is based on using machine learning to identify abnormalities in radiographs such as breaks/fractures and other abnormalities.

## Installation
To use the project, you will need to pull the zip file or pull the project to your machine using git. There is no installation wizard/walk through as of yet. Simply download the project as a zip.

The dataset is available on [this google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uayhATto7TRtJk88dsMtoyUAai3aYkw6). Please download and copy this file into project folder and then you will be able to train the machine learning models.

**There are some images in the 'usr_in' folder for testing purposes**

## Usage
To use the project, you much run it from a venv that has all of the requirements installed from the 'requirements.txt' file.

### Create virtual env
To run the venv:
```
python3 -m venv {name your venv}
```
e.g.
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
Then start the venv:
on Windows:
```
Scripts\activate.bat
```
or
```
Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### Install requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### running the project
Look at the main.py file as there is some configuration that can be done there in order to get the project to behave differently.

To run the project:
```
python3 main.py
```

## Project Status
The project is complete for now, but it is open to more development and experimentation in the future.
